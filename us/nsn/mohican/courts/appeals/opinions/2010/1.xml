    <text>The Honorable Robert Miller, Jr., Chief Judge of the Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Court published case <u>2008-CV-033</u> on July 22, 2009 and wrote, <em>"...it is apparent that Tribal Law was disregarded summarily"</em> and ordered the case dismissed with prejudice.</text>
    <text>Appellant appealed that decision on August 10, 2009, even if weekends or holidays were not included, appellant's appeal should have been submitted by July 29, 2009. Appellant's appeal was seventeen (17) calendar days later. According to <cite doc="Old Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code" path="§46.6">Stockbridge-Munsee Housing Code, Section 46.6-12</cite>, Appellant's appeal is untimely. <cite doc="Old Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code" path="§46.6">Section 46.6-12</cite>,</text>

All orders from the court will remain in effect during the pendency of an appeal under this Ordinance unless otherwise ordered by the court. If applicable, a party may utilize appeal procedures of 25.C.F.R. Part 2.</text>
    </include>
    <text>Court procedures are written to ensure fairness. The Court found Respondent's appeal is untimely. Therefore, the Court dismisses Appellant's appeal due to untimely filing.</text>
