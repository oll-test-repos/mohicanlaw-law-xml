      <text>This case originated before the Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Trial Court with judgment granting divorce to Lynne I. Miller from Charles Loud on September 29, 2000. Post-judgment issues arose requiring further review by Trial Court. In 2010, Petitioner, Lynne I. Miller sought an injunction to restrain Tribal Judge Robert Miller, the judge of record on the case, from presiding over any pending or future litigation, to which she is a party before the Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Court. Judge Miller, filed a Motion to Dismiss, based on Tribal Judicial Immunity. On December 9, 2010, Judge Candice Des Armo Coury found Judge Miller has Tribal Judicial Immunity and dismissed Lynne I. Miller's petition for injunction. On December 29, 2010, Lynne I. Miller filed a Notice of Intent to appeal the trial court's dismissal of case No. 2010-RO-0008, claiming the court abused its discretion. On or about January 13, 2011, Judge Coury filed a written decision of the December 9, 2010 hearing.</text>

      <text>The litigation involving Ms. Miller originated as a divorce action with the Tribal Trial Court granting Appellant a divorce from her husband Charles Loud on September 29, 2000. On October 5, 2001, Judge Miller held a hearing on Lynne Miller's petition to evict ex-husband Charles Loud. The written decision filed on February 11, 2002 denied eviction. On January 19, 2007, Judge Miller summoned everyone back into court because of confusion in original September 29, 2000 divorce judgment and competing liabilities citing the "duty of the court to dispose of this case finally." According to Appellant Lynne I. Miller, she received notice to appear in court on October 14, 2010 and Show Cause why she should not be held in contempt of Court. On October 14, 2010, Appellant failed to appear for a scheduled hearing claiming her advocate withdrew from her case. Appellant, believing the Tribal Trial Court would reschedule the hearing because her advocate withdrew, did not appear for the October 14, 2010 hearing. Appellant instead filed a petition starting the case before us and sought to restrain Tribal Judge Robert Miller from presiding over any current or future cases to which Ms. Miller is a party before the Tribal Court. On December 7, 2010, Respondent Tribal Judge Robert Miller filed a motion to dismiss Appellant's petition based on Tribal Judicial Immunity. On December 9, 2010, Tribal Judge Candice Des Armo Coury held a hearing on Appellant's petition for injunction against Judge Miller and granted Judge Miller's motion to dismiss.</text>

      <text>On January 13, 2011, Judge Coury filed a written decision of the December 9, 2010 hearing before Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Court on Case No. 2010-RO-0008. Judge Coury refused to re-litigate or re-hear issues from the divorce action since Judge Miller is the Judge of record and is familiar with the facts of the case, and should maintain the file for any post-judgment relief that might be sought. Tribal Judge Coury sustained Tribal Judge Miller's motion to dismiss Appellant's petition based upon Tribal Judicial Immunity. Appellant appeals the Tribal Court's decision claiming abuse of discretion.</text>

      <text>Appellant claims that according to the Indian Civil Rights Act her civil rights were violated. Appellant claims the Tribal Court did not hold a hearing on December 9, 2010. Appellant further claims that, "In the case at bar, Lynne I. Miller claimed a violation of due process law in that the tribal judge did not follow proper procedure in administering justice in her divorce case. He deliberately disregarded material facts in her case. He did not have jurisdiction over the divorce matter because the hearings were not supported by a written motion. A lawful conclusion of the divorce action is being blocked. The judge has displayed partiality. These are violations of due process of law which strip him of immunity." Appellant also claims that the standard of review for summary judgment should be reviewed de novo citing a case decided in the State of Wisconsin and Wisconsin State Statue: <cite doc="2009 WI 70"><em>Hocking V. City of Dodgeville, 2009 WI 70, 318 Wis 2</em><sup><em>nd</em></sup><em> 681, 768 N.W. 2</em><sup><em>nd</em></sup><em> 552</em></cite> and <em><cite doc="Wis.

      <text>Whether judicial immunity applies is a question of law, not a question of discretion therefore reviewing for an abuse of discretion is not applicable. Discretion arises when the trial court has a range of options such as sentencing a criminal defendant or sharing children's time between their parents. The question is a legal one: Does judicial immunity apply? Because the question is one of law, we will review it de novo, meaning without deference to the conclusion of the trial court.</text>

      <text>Judicial Officers benefit from judicial immunity, which means that they cannot be held liable for decisions rendered in the course of their duties as a Judicial Officer. This is a broad immunity and may only be disturbed in limited circumstances, such as when an abuse of authority is alleged and substantiated. No such allegation is present. Suit against a judge is only permitted in the extreme circumstance where a court has gone completely outside the law. Appellate review is always available when a party disagrees with the ruling of the Court.</text>
