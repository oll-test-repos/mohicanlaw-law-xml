    <text>This matter came before the Honorable Gregory D. Smith, Chief Justice of the Stockbridge-Munsee Court of Appeals, on the 14<sup>th</sup> day of September, 2018, upon the Community's petition to seek an interlocutory appeal challenging the Tribal Court's denial of a motion to recuse. Although interlocutory appeals are disfavored, due to under-developed records and piecemeal litigation, this matter is significant and delay could cause needless litigation. The petition to review the recusal ruling is well-founded.<fn path="|footnotes|1">1</fn> Further, since this is a significant issue that will impact multiple other cases, the matter shall be heard <em><u>en banc</u></em> by this Court pursuant to <cite doc="Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code" path="§TCT.01.09|(g)|(2)|(A)">S-M Tribal Code § 1.9(G) (2)(a)</cite>. Oral arguments are ordered pursuant to <cite doc="Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code" path="§TCT.02.22|(c)">S-M Tribal Code § 5.22 (C)</cite> and shall be conducted by Skype or similar visual social media for out-of-town justices. The litigants shall present arguments live and physically present at the Stockbridge-Munsee Courthouse. Oral arguments shall be limited to fifteen (15) minutes per side and this time shall be strictly enforced. <strong>Wherefore, premises considered;</strong></text>

      <text>This Court is deeming the Community's notice of appeal as a petition requesting interlocutory review. This Court finds, pursuant to <cite doc="Old Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code" path="§1.9|(G)|(3)">S-M Tribal Code § 1.9(G(3)</cite>, that it could have refused to hear this matter until a final judgment on the case is rendered.
