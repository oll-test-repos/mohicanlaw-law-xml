      <text>In their February 6<sup>th</sup>, 2017 petition in the Tribal Court, Appellants alleged that they received notice from the Community that their wages would be frozen pursuant to a new wage scale adopted by the Community. As a result, Appellant Hoffman's employment wages from the Community were frozen until 2022 and Appellant Miller's employment wages were frozen until 2024.</text>

      <text>Appellants requested remedies available under <cite doc="Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code" path="§EMP.03.15">§55.15 of the Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Fair Labor Standards Ordinance</cite> including back-pay, actual damages, punitive damages and legal fees.</text>

      <num>&#182;4</num>
      <text>On March 6, 2018, the Community reconsidered the wage freeze and by motion unfroze the employee wages. Subsequent to the Community's action, the Tribal HR department paid the amount of back wages owed the Appellees. The HR determination was that Appellants would receive back-pay based on the difference between what Appellants would have received without the wage freeze and what they actually were paid. Appellant Hoffman received back- pay in the amount of $2963.45 and Appellant Miller received back-pay in the amount of $1439.90.</text>
