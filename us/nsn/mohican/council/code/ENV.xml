          <text>The purpose of this policy is to refine the bidding process for sales of forest products by the Tribe and the BIA.

            <text>Tribal Logger bids #3		$ 87,000</text>
            <text>Tribal Logger #3 bid is too low to be considered for preference.  The bid is below the 10% maximum difference to be considered for the sale.</text>
            <text>Tribal Logger bid #1 is within the 10% maximum difference.  However, Tribal Logger bid #2 is the higher bid between the eligible Tribal Loggers.  Therefore, Tribal Logger Bid #1 does not receive the timber sale contract.</text>
            <text>Tribal Logger bid #2 is the highest preference bid with the 10% maximum difference.  #2 would be required to match the $100,000 bid, but will receive a rebate of $6,000 upon the successful completion of the timber sale.</text>
            <text>Timber Company ABC would not get the timber sale contract because Tribal Logger bid #2 would be awarded the timber sale contract.  Because Tribal Logger #2's bid is within 10% of the highest bid (Timber Company ABC), and it would match the $4,000 difference, Timber Company ABC and Tribal Logger #2 are essentially bidding at $100,000.</text>

            <text>Tribal Logger #3 bid is too low to be considered for preference.  The bid is below the 10% maximum difference to be considered for the sale.</text>
            <text>Tribal Logger bid #1 is within the 10% maximum difference.  However, Tribal Logger bid #2 is the higher bid between the eligible Tribal Loggers.  Therefore, Tribal Logger Bid #1 does not receive the timber sale contract.</text>
            <text>Tribal Logger bid #2 is the highest preference bid with the 10% maximum difference.  #2 would be required to match the $100,000 bid, but will receive a rebate of $6,000 upon the successful completion of the timber sale.</text>
            <text>Timber Company ABC would not get the timber sale contract because Tribal Logger bid #2 would be awarded the timber sale contract.  Because Tribal Logger #2's bid is within 10% of the highest bid (Timber Company ABC), and it would match the $4,000 difference, Timber Company ABC and Tribal Logger #2 are essentially bidding at $100,000.</text>
