      <text>The collection of the tax imposed by this article shall be administered by the Tribal Treasurer.  The tax imposed is due and payable on the last day of the month next succeeding the calendar quarters for which imposed.  A return shall be filed with the Tribal Treasurer by those furnishing at retail such rooms and lodging, on or before the same date on which the tax is due and payable.  Such return shall show the gross receipts of the preceding calendar quarters from such retail furnishings of rooms or lodging, the amount of taxes imposed for such period, and such other non-confidential information as the Tribal Treasurer deems reasonably necessary.  Every person required to file such a quarterly return shall, with their first return, elect to file an annual calendar or fiscal year return.  Such annual returns shall be filed within 90 days of the close of each fiscal year.  The annual return shall summarize the quarterly returns, reconcile and adjust for errors in the quarterly returns, and shall contain such additional non-confidential information as the Tribal Treasurer requires.  Such annual returns shall be made on forms as prescribed by the Tribal Treasurer.  All such returns shall be signed by the person required to file a return.  The Tribal Treasurer may, for good cause, extend the time for filing any return, but in no event longer than one month from the filing date.</text>
