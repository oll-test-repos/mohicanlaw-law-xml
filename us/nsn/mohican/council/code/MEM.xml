          <text>On December 3, 2019, by Resolution No. 18-20, the Tribal Council adopted amendments to Chapter 44 to modify the calculation of Blood Quantum for the adoption of new Members by establishing 1940 baseline for the calculation of Blood Quantum, clarifying the enrollment process used to adopt new Members, and making other administrative updates.  The specific amendments are as follows:</text>
          <text>
            <ul proof="needed">
              <li>Headings added to the ordinance sections.</li>
              <li>Section 44.1 amended to add new subsections (A) and (C) clarifying the purpose of the ordinance is to address how new Members are adopted into the Tribe, as well as identify the authority under the Constitution and provide definitions.  Prior language under Section 44.1 now under subsection (B), which was clarified.</li>
              <li>Section 44.2 amended to delete reference to Membership Committee accepting applications for adoption since accepted by Land and Enrollment Department and add language that Committee reviews all applications.</li>
              <li>Section 44.4 amended to add new subsections (A) and (C) establishing new baseline of 1940 roll for calculating Blood Quantum and modifying prior language referencing other rolls to clarify that members identified in them treated as if full blood as well.  Prior language was amended and designated as subsection (B).</li>
              <li>Section 44.45 established as new Section.  Language unchanged; had previously been part of Section 44.4.</li>
              <li>Section 44.5 amended to clarify that it establishes eligibility criteria for adoption as a new Member of the Tribe.</li>
              <li>Section 44.6 amended to add new subsections (A)(1)-(5); (B); (C); (D); and (E).  These provisions describe the process used to enroll new Members; calculate Blood Quantum; and address membership records.  Language that previously had been (A) modified to add reference to enrollment process described in subsections 1-5.  Language previously in subsection (B) about other documents that may be considered deleted since no longer relevant due to the new 1940 baseline approach toward Blood Quantum.  Language about denial of enrollment that had been in subsection (C) moved to new section.</li>
              <li>Section 44.65 is new section with materials that had previously been subsection 44.6 (C). No substantive changes (some wording changes based on definitions and cross references updated) other than to add a new subsection (D) identifying that a denial of enrollment is final unless there is a material change in circumstances.</li>
              <li>Section 44.8 amended to clarify the ordinance does not waive the Tribe's sovereign immunity.</li>
            </ul>
